This userscript removes all recommended posts from communities you aren't subscribed to from your Reddit timeline. Reddit has recently started pushing posts with the following descriptions to users' timelines: "Because you've shown interest in a similar community", "Because you've shown interest in this community", "Popular near you", "Suggested"

I noticed that these posts upset me more than they don't. This script just hides all of them and prints a counter to the console. It automatically removes all recommendations that are lazy-loaded after you hit the page end as well.
